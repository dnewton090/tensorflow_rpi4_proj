# Object Detection on Raspberry Pi 4B (TF 1.15, OpenCV 3.4)

Adapting a great existing tutorial by @EdjeElectronics

The code is broken however, but after weeks of inspection it finally boiled down to finding a custom binary developed by @PINTO0039 -- many thanks for your efforts  successful patching TensorFlow issues #15062,#21574,#21855,#23082,#25120,#25748,#29617,#29704,#30359 and
 developing a working binary wheel for the RPi 4 on Armv7l.

Newer tutorials also mention @lheontra for his work developing TF 2.x binaries for Arm -- muito obrigado por seus esforcos continuous -- and driving me to inspect how binaries were constructed. 

Detailed instructions to come...
